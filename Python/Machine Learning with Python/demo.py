        This method is expected to be called several times consecutively

        This is especially useful when the whole dataset is too big to fit in
        memory at once.
        This method has some performance and numerical stability overhead,
        hence it is better to call partial_fit on chunks of data that are
        as large as possible (as long as fitting in the memory budget) to
        hide the overhead.
